The project was developed remotely using the RAI system. The specified 
commands to build and run the project were written in a bash file (rai-build.yml).

We use the command following command to speed up the compilation as the 
system already contains the dependencies (like HDF5 and ZLib).  
		cmake -DCONFIG_USE_HUNTER=OFF /src 

The command to run the program is 
		./ece408 /src/data/<dataset_file> /src/data/model.hdf5 <batch_size>

For our remote development, once the rai-build.yml was set up, we build 
and ran the project by using the command - 
		./rai -d <project folder>
